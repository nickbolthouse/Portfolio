This is a copy of a college project I submitted. It is a game played directly in the command line (or unix shell), similarly to Star Treck (1971). The premise is that you play the role of a RealEstate developer, trying to make a profit while balancing the ongoing maintainance, tennants, and new environmental legislation. It wasn't ever completed the way I had wished, but for ~30 hours of work, it is a respectable result. Hopefully in the future I will have time to properly finish the game I designed.
